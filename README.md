2. User Personas
- Myra is a 20 year old student at UC Berkeley who’s first year was online due to the pandemic. This will be her first time away from her hometown in Ohio, so she would really like to make some friends before she gets to school. Having an app to match her with someone she has a high similarity with can take some of the pressure off. She also doesn’t know exactly what kinds of activities or places are most popular around her area, so having personalized suggestions of activity ideas to do together would make her more motivated to reach out.
- Jake is an 18 year old college student at UT Austin. It is currently New Student Orientation, and people always seem to be going out and making new friends. He has talked to a few people, but is introverted and nervous about reaching out to make plans. This app would allow him to make an instant connection with someone who shares similar interests and receive suggested opening lines along with meetup ideas so that he feels better about reaching out.

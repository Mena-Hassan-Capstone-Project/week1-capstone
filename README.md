2. User Personas
- Myra is a 19 year old college student who just moved from Ohio to the Bay Area for a summer internship. She uses her phone and laptop everyday, and is very comfortable with technology. She would access the app whenever she is looking for somewhere to go out, so perhaps on weekends and some weekday nights. She would access the website both on her computer and phone. She wants to explore popular restaurants and cuisines around her, but doesnâ€™t know where to start.
- Elden is a 35 year old teacher who lives in a suburb in Texas. He is relatively comfortable with technology. He usually browses on his computer because he fumbles with his phone sometimes. He just switched to veganism for his health, but none of the restaurants he usually goes to have very extensive vegan options. He would access the app especially often when first starting out in order to try different vegan restaurants near him.
- Tony is a 55 year old small business owner from Nashville. He has been running his family Italian restaurant along with his 2 brothers for the past 30 years. While he is not extremely tech savvy, he is able to navigate through pages on his laptop, especially if the UI is simple. While he has some regular customers, he has been wanting to expand his customer base since many new people, especially young people, have been moving to the city. The app would help him update his menu in real time and suggest his restaurant to customers who might be interested.
- Aisha, 32,  just opened her Indian fusion restaurant in downtown Los Angeles. This has been her dream since she was young. She is experienced with technology since she worked briefly as a Software Engineer. She is savvy with both her phone and laptop, but prefers working on her laptop. She wants to publicize her opening and provide additional descriptions about her menu items, since she developed some of them herself. Her items can be a bit confusing, but she put a lot of effort into developing her own take on her cultural cuisine. She would access the app whenever she wanted to make any kind of update or edit, or was holding an event.
